# Partial Credit Matters

This is a really important mindset for interviews.  

Of course it would be nice to do everything perfectly, but it's not required in order to pass an interview. If you can't get a 100%, at least ensure you get a 90% by spending your time on the most valuable actions.


## Coding skills

Competent coding skills are table stakes for a software engineer. If you can't write code, it doesn't matter how good you are at communication, analysis, testing, optimization, or anything else. [Code katas](https://hthuman.github.io/tech-interview-tips/code-katas) are a great way to improve your fluency.

* **Focus on the core logic**: Use helper functions with TODOs to defer non-essential code implementation. Come back later if you have time after writing the main code.
* **Write ANY code**: If you're running out of time but you have a non-optimal solution, ask if you can code it up and work on the optimal approach later.  

## Big O complexity analysis

This is a close second to coding skills in importance, especially if you are interviewing at a company or team that works at scale.

When doing coding katas, memorize the time/space complexity of each algorithm.

If you can't get an optimal solution, it's almost as good if you can reach a non-optimal solution and explain precisely why it is non-optimal. Bonus points if you can also talk about the theoretical max efficiency.
