# Partial Credit Matters

You can absolutely still pass a coding interview even if you don’t get the question perfectly right on your own.


## Mechanical coding skills

This is the one thing you must show, but happily it’s also the easiest to train for. Unless the interviewer suggests otherwise, it’s better to start coding with a non-optimal solution than it is to barely write code because you are spending all your time trying to find the perfect solution. Just be sure to call out that you know it’s non-optimal and why.

## Big O complexity analysis

This is a close second in importance, especially if you are interviewing at a large scale company. When doing coding katas, memorize the time/space complexity of each tool. If you can’t get the optimal solution, you can at least explain why your solution is inefficient and talk about the theoretical max efficiency of any solution.

## Communication
All software is written in large teams which means communication is often the major bottleneck. Because of this, many companies explicitly look for communication skills. Interviewers are completely prepared to provide hints and guidance, as long as you are able to clearly communicate what you are thinking and where you are lost.

## Testing

You don’t need to write code perfectly the first time as long as you can go back later and find the bugs.
