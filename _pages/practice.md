# Practice Being Nervous

Interviews are very stressful. Performing under pressure is another separate skill that can and should be practiced.

Do many mock interviews, and ensure that they make you nervous in some way.

Suggestions:
* Have your friends interview you.
* You can sign up for practice interview sites where engineers will interview you for free.
* At the very least, donâ€™t schedule the interview you want the most first.
