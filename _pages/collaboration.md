# Collaborative Attitude

Treat the interview as a collaborative problem solving exercise.

Your interviewer wants you to succeed and will be prepared with several hints to help you along if you get stuck.

## Verbalize your thoughts

It feels awkward, but learn how to say everything you are thinking out loud. This lets the interviewer know if you are on the wrong path so they can steer you in the right direction.

## Listen for feedback

Pay attention to everything your interviewer says.

If they ask questions, they are probably trying to get you to consider some other angle, or to lead you in the right direction.
