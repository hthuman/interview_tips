# Collaborative Attitude

Treat the interview as a collaborative problem solving exercise and work with your interviewer as a partner.

Your interviewer wants you to succeed and will have several hints prepared in case you get stuck.

## There is no shame taking hints

I've given my interview questions to candidates of all levels and I almost always give at least one hint to help them find the answer.

In fact, I deliberately chose my main problem because it's difficult enough that most candidates do get stuck.

Software engineering is full of tough problems with no obvious solutions. I want to see how candidates handle this situation, how they are able to analyze a problem, and most of all, how well they work with others to build towards a solution.

Feedback and collaboration are crucial parts of software development. If a candidate ignores hints or reacts in a hostile manner (surprisingly common), it makes me concerned about how they would react to feedback in a work environment.

  Candidates get rejected for poor collaboration even if they write great code or find the optimal solution.
  
  I was on a loop where everyone unanimously rejected a candidate for this reason. They answered the questions correctly, but were dismissive and hostile towards interviewers.

## Think out loud

One common mistake candidates make is to sit in silence until they get the answer.

Don't think of the interview as a quiz. Think of it as solving a technical problem with a partner.

Explaining your thought process allows the interviewer to stop you from going down the wrong path and to give you effective hints. 

I've tried to give hints to silent candidates only to hear them impatiently tell me that they already know. I have multiple hints prepared depending on where the candidate gets stuck, but if I don't know what they are thinking, I don't know which will be most useful.

Additionally, thinking out loud can offer an opportunity to impress the interviewer with your ability to analyze a problem and break it down.

## Pay attention to everything your interviewer says.

The one difference between problem solving with a coworker and problem solving during an interview is that your interviewer knows the right answer. This means everything they say will be relevant.

If they ask questions, they are most likely pointing out a flaw or trying to lead you in the right direction.

If they make a suggestion, listen. I've flat out said "try using a hashmap" to a candidate who told me it wasn't going to work and then refused to explain why they didn't think it would.
