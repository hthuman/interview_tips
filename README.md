# How to Prepare for Tech Interviews

Tech interviews are their own skill that can be improved through practice.

Interviews are about more than solving a coding puzzle perfectly, which means that preparing for them requires more than just memorizing leetcode solutions.

**About me**: I am a senior engineer with 15+ years of experience at FAANG companies and I give about 1 interview a week. This guide is written to help you avoid the most common mistakes that I see candidates make during interviews.

## Timeline of a Coding Interview

Interviews are usually between 25 and 60 minutes, depending on whether the interview starts with a behavioral or knowledge question.

There may be multiple questions, or multiple parts to the same question to increase the difficulty.

Assuming the interview is 40 minutes and 1 question, here's how a breakdown of where your time is spent might look:

1. **Understanding the problem**: 5 minutes
2. **Finding the solution**: 10 minutes
    * [Coding katas](coding-katas) enable you to recognize which tools apply to the problem
    * [Communication](collaboration) is vital here. Your interview wants you to succeed and will be providing hints if they see you going the wrong direction.
    * [Test your solution](testing) before starting to code. You can also verify with your interviewer that your approach is good.
4. **Coding the solution**: 15 minutes
    * [Coding katas](coding-katas) minimize the amount of time this takes so you can focus more on steps 2 and 4
6. **Testing/fixing/optimizing**: 10 minutes
    * [Test your code](testing). It *will* have bugs
