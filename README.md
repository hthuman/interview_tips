# How to Prepare for Tech Interviews

Tech interviews are their own skill that can be improved through practice.

Interviews are about more than solving a coding puzzle perfectly, which means that preparing for them requires more than just memorizing leetcode solutions.

**About me**: I am a senior engineer with 15+ years of experience at FAANG companies and I give about 1 interview a week. This guide is written to help you avoid the most common mistakes that I see candidates make during interviews.

## Timeline of a Coding Interview

Interviews are usually between 25 and 60 minutes, depending on whether the interview starts with a behavioral or knowledge question.

There may be multiple questions, or multiple parts to the same question to increase the difficulty.

Assuming the interview is 40 minutes and 1 question, here's how a breakdown of where your time is spent might look:

1. **Understanding the problem**: 5 minutes
2. **Finding the solution**: 10 minutes
    * [Coding katas](coding-katas) enable you to recognize which tools apply to the problem
    * [Communication](collaboration) is vital here. Your interview wants you to succeed and will be providing hints if they see you going the wrong direction.
    * [Test your solution](testing) before starting to code. You can also verify with your interviewer that your approach is good.
4. **Coding the solution**: 15 minutes
    * [Coding katas](coding-katas) minimize the amount of time this takes so you can focus more on steps 2 and 4
6. **Testing/fixing/optimizing**: 10 minutes
    * [Test your code](testing). It *will* have bugs

## Mindset Tips

* **Embrace failure**: The interview process produces false negatives by design. Everyone fails many interviews before they are accepted.
* **Partial credit matters**: You can absolutely still pass a coding interview even if you don't get the question perfectly right. Examples of other qualities interviewers look for:
    * **Mechanical coding skill**: This is the one thing you must show, but happily it's also the easiest to train for. Unless the interviewer suggests otherwise, it's better to start coding with a non-optimal solution than it is to barely write code because you are spending all your time trying to find the perfect solution. Just be sure to call out that you know it's non-optimal and why.
    * **Time/space complexity analysis**: This is a close second in importance, especially if you are interviewing at a large scale company. When doing coding katas, memorize the time/space complexity of each tool. If you can't get the optimal solution, you can at least explain why your solution is inefficient and talk about the theoretical max efficiency of any solution.
    * **Communication**: All software is written in large teams which means communication is often the major bottleneck. Because of this, many companies explicitly look for communication skills. Interviewers are completely prepared to provide hints and guidance, as long as you are able to clearly communicate what you are thinking and where you are lost.
    * **Testing**: You don't need to write code perfectly the first time as long as you can go back later and find the bugs.
* **Practice being nervous**: Interviews are very stressful. Practice performing under pressure.
    * Have your friends interview you.
    * You can sign up for practice interview sites where engineers will interview you for free.
    * At the very least, don't schedule the interview you want the most first.
