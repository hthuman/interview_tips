 # Coding Katas

Candidates usually focus on studying algorithms and practicing hard-level problems on leetcode/hackerrank/etc., but this approach only addresses a fraction of the skills required to succeed at coding interviews. 

My approach focuses heavily on drilling the basics through a technique called **coding katas**.

The concept borrows from martial arts where students will perform a pre-defined series of movements called *katas* in order to perfect techniques and build muscle memory.

Coding katas have the same goal of perfecting coding techniques and problem solving approaches and ingraining them into your mind so that you no longer have to work hard to make use of them.

They help you build up a coding toolkit that you can use fluently even during high pressure situations like interviews.

I also use them before interviews to calm me down and get myself into the right mental space.

## List of katas

For every kata, do the following:
* **Practice until you can confidently and quickly code the solution.** It's fine to look up optimal solutions, just ensure that you understand every line and why it's better than other approaches
* **Think about the time/space complexity as you code.** Think about this with every line you write. When allocating supplemental data structures, think about how this impacts space complexity. When you add a for loop, think about what this means for time complexity.

Even 5 minutes of practice on one of these is beneficial. You don't need to grind for hours on these, you just need to do a little bit regularly until you are able to just sit down and confidently code the solution without backtracking or hesitation.

### Linked Lists
* **Compare two linked lists** ([hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-two-linked-lists/problem))

### Trees
* **In-order traversal** ([hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-inorder-traversal/problem))
  * Time complexity: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes. This is because you are visiting every node in the tree during a traversal.
  * Useful for: Visiting binary search tree nodes in order
* **Pre-order traversal** ([hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-preorder-traversal/problem))
* **Post-order traversal** ([hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-postorder-traversal/problem))

### Graphs
